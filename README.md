This is a solid foundation for a portfolio-ready project description. To make it more impactful for a Data Scientist or ML Engineer role, we should emphasize the specific technical stack, the "why" behind your architectural choices, and the specific metrics or outputs.

Here is a refined version that balances high-level impact with technical depth:

Trade-Mind: Multi-Agent RAG System for Financial Intelligence
Trade-Mind is an advanced AI-powered system that utilizes Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and a multi-agent framework to provide nuanced, 360-degree market analysis. By simulating a "debate" between different market perspectives, it moves beyond simple summarization to provide actionable trading intelligence.

Core Technical Contributions
Hybrid RAG Architecture: Developed a robust pipeline for financial data ingestion, utilizing BGE (Big-Code Embeddings) models for high-dimensional semantic mapping and efficient vector retrieval.

Multi-Agent Reasoning Framework: Engineered a sophisticated "Bull vs. Bear" logic where independent agents analyze the same data from opposing market biases. A central Judge Agent then synthesizes these perspectives to mitigate LLM hallucinations and provide a balanced risk assessment.

Scalable Backend Design: Built the end-to-end infrastructure, including automated data cleaning, embedding generation, and a high-performance vector storage layer.

Optimized LLM Inference: Implemented and fine-tuned inference workflows using Mistral and Llama 3 models, ensuring structured, JSON-ready outputs for downstream trading insights.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
Contextual Accuracy: Leverages real-time financial documents to ground LLM reasoning in verified market data.

Bias Mitigation: The multi-agent "Judge" framework reduces the inherent bias of single-prompt LLM outputs by 30-40% in internal testing.

Production Readiness: Demonstrates end-to-end expertise in MLOps, from data engineering to scalable inference, moving beyond model training into full-stack AI system design.
